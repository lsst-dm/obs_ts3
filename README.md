This is an unfished project which nobody necessarily intends to finish.
The code is being left here in case someone wants to pick it up some day,
but that may never happen.

The package does not work properly, has non-compliant commits in its history
because it never made it to v1.0, and has no tests, so will rot over time.

We do not suggest this package be used for anything.
Should you use it, caveat emptor.
